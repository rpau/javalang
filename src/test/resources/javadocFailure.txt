**
 * Static convenience methods that help a method or constructor check whether it was invoked
 * correctly (whether its <i>preconditions</i> have been met). These methods generally accept a
 * {@code boolean} expression which is expected to be {@code true} (or in the case of
 * {@code checkNotNull}, an object reference which is expected to be non-null). When {@code false}
 * (or {@code null}) is passed instead, the {@code Preconditions} method throws an unchecked
 * exception, which helps the calling method communicate to <i>its</i> caller that <i>that</i>
 * caller has made a mistake. Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 
 *   /**
 *    * Returns the positive square root of the given value.
 *    *
 *    * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the value is negative
 *    *}{@code /
 *   public static double sqrt(double value) {
 *     Preconditions.checkArgument(value >= 0.0, "negative value: %s", value);
 *     // calculate the square root
 *   }
 * 
 *   void exampleBadCaller() {
 *     double d = sqrt(-1.0);
 *   }}
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, {@code checkArgument} throws an {@code IllegalArgumentException} to indicate
 * that {@code exampleBadCaller} made an error in <i>its</i> call to {@code sqrt}.
 *
 * <h3>Warning about performance</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The goal of this class is to improve readability of code, but in some circumstances this may come
 * at a significant performance cost. Remember that parameter values for message construction must
 * all be computed eagerly, and autoboxing and varargs array creation may happen as well, even when
 * the precondition check then succeeds (as it should almost always do in production). In some
 * circumstances these wasted CPU cycles and allocations can add up to a real problem.
 * Performance-sensitive precondition checks can always be converted to the customary form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 
 *   if (value < 0.0) {
 *     throw new IllegalArgumentException("negative value: " + value);
 *   }}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Other types of preconditions</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Not every type of precondition failure is supported by these methods. Continue to throw standard
 * JDK exceptions such as {@link java.util.NoSuchElementException} or
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} in the situations they are intended for.
 *
 * <h3>Non-preconditions</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is of course possible to use the methods of this class to check for invalid conditions which
 * are <i>not the caller's fault</i>. Doing so is <b>not recommended</b> because it is misleading to
 * future readers of the code and of stack traces. See <a
 * href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ConditionalFailuresExplained">Conditional
 * failures explained</a> in the Guava User Guide for more advice.
 *
 * <h3>{@code java.util.Objects.requireNonNull()}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Projects which use {@code com.google.common} should generally avoid the use of
 * {@link java.util.Objects#requireNonNull(Object)}. Instead, use whichever of
 * {@link #checkNotNull(Object)} or {@link Verify#verifyNotNull(Object)} is appropriate to the
 * situation. (The same goes for the message-accepting overloads.)
 *
 * <h3>Only {@code %s} is supported</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * In {@code Preconditions} error message template strings, only the {@code "%s"} specifier is
 * supported, not the full range of {@link java.util.Formatter} specifiers.
 *
 * <h3>More information</h3>

 * {@code Preconditions}</a>.
